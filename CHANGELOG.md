## [v0.3.0] - 2025-04-14

### Added
- Upload support for `.txt` and `.docx` SRS files via Streamlit UI
- Utility function `read_uploaded_file()` for clean decoding and fallback
- LLM test suggestion logic now respects skipped analysis cases
- Unit tests for all file upload scenarios (valid, invalid, none)

### Fixed
- Removed hallucinated test cases for empty or malformed sections
- JSON and Markdown outputs now cleanly reflect analysis skips

### Known Issues
- Parser does not yet detect informal title-case headers (e.g., "Scope", "Purpose") ‚Äî fix scheduled for next release

## [v0.4.0] - 2025-04-15

### Added
- Title-case fallback header detection for informal SRS sections (e.g., "Scope", "Purpose")
- TOC filtering for `.txt` files using dotted-line pattern matching (early line scan)
- TOC filtering for `.docx` files using style-based detection (e.g., "TOC 1", "TOC Heading")
- Unit tests for fallback headers and TOC behavior in both input types

### Notes
- `.docx` TOC filtering leverages paragraph styles; documents without TOC styles are currently not filtered by content ‚Äî fallback detection deferred
- Optional enhancements like multiline header collapsing and smart line joining are scoped for later

## [v0.5.0] - 2025-04-16

### Added
- `header_rules.py` module for modular header detection logic (moved from `parser.py`)
- Markdown output now includes structured headings: `#`, `##`, `###`
- Clean UI rendering component (`render_section_result()`) extracted to `ui/components.py`

### Changed
- `streamlit_app.py` refactored to separate UI layout and logic
- Markdown output updated with clearer body/analysis/test sections
- Test suite updated to match new Markdown structure and refactored imports

## [v0.6.0] - TOC Conformance Comparison

### Added
- `toc_extractor.py`: Functions to extract TOC-style lines from `.txt` and `.docx` inputs using shared detection logic.
- `standard_toc.py`: Central definition of standard TOC structure for structural comparison.
- `toc_comparator.py`: Logic to compare extracted TOC against standard structure with reporting of matched, missing, and extra sections.
- Unit tests for all TOC extraction and comparison utilities.

### Changed
- Moved `is_docx_toc_paragraph()` from `file_reader.py` to `header_rules.py` for shared access across parser, extractor, and test logic.

### Notes
- All tests pass (including mocked `.docx` TOC tests for style matching).
- Lays foundation for structural conformance UI/export and future user-uploaded standard comparison.

## [v0.7.0] ‚Äì TOC Conformance Check Added (Day 17)
### Added
- Structural conformance check: compare document TOC to `STANDARD_TOC`
- `structure_check.py` orchestration module
- `extract_toc_lines_from_docx()` supports both style and text-pattern detection
- `clean_toc_line()` normalization: handles dotted numbering (e.g., `1.2. Scope`)
- `test_structure_check.py` covering `.txt` and `.docx` logic
- Streamlit UI section: "Run Structure Check" with matched/missing/extra display
- `@pytest.mark.xfail` tests for LLM-based fuzzy matching (future feature placeholder)

### Fixed
- TOC parser now correctly detects malformed `.docx` TOC entries styled as `"Normal"`
- TOC matching logic adjusted to avoid false negatives from formatting quirks

## [v0.8.0] ‚Äì TOC vs Parsed Structure Comparison
### Added
- `compare_toc_to_parsed_sections()` compares extracted TOC lines to actual parsed section titles
- Normalized comparison using `section['id'] + title` for stronger structural validation
- Identifies matched, missing, and extra sections between TOC and document body
- Unit tests for title-only match, extra section detection, case and whitespace normalization
- `@pytest.mark.xfail` coverage for ID+title composite matching and non-normalized return behavior (to be addressed in future)

### Fixed
- Clarified matching behavior by returning parsed section titles (not raw TOC lines) in matched results
- Adjusted test case inputs to reflect normalized structure for strict mode

### Notes
- Matching logic is deterministic and robust; fuzzy matching will be added separately in `v0.10.0+`
- README update deferred to v1.0 polish

## [v0.9.0] ‚Äì LLM Error Handling & Test Coverage Alignment

### Added
- Centralized `get_client()` logic for OpenAI API key management
- Full test coverage for `analyze_requirement()` and `suggest_tests()` with correct mocking and input handling
- Support for OpenAI failure fallback logic and malformed response detection

### Fixed
- Removed invalid `pytest.raises()` tests that conflicted with catch-all exception logic
- Corrected monkeypatch behavior by moving `load_dotenv()` back to top of `llm.py`
- CI environment now reflects correct API key behavior during tests

### Known Issues
- Assistant guidance during test implementation phase was inconsistent and caused unnecessary rework
- Additional test validation should be applied in final polish phase to ensure return-based testing is consistent

## [v0.9.1] ‚Äì LLM TOC Comparison + Lint Compliance

### Added
- `compare_toc_sections_with_llm()` function in `llm.py` for fuzzy TOC-to-standard comparison using GPT-4
- Full test suite for the new function, including:
  - Valid input test
  - Empty/malformed response handling
  - `xfail` test for semantic equivalence
- `use_llm` toggle in `compare_toc()` (`toc_comparator.py`) to enable LLM fallback without affecting strict comparison
- Mocked test in `test_toc_comparator.py` to validate LLM integration

### Fixed
- Removed all unused imports (`F401`) across app and test files
- Replaced unnecessary f-strings missing placeholders (`F541`)
- Fixed spacing/blank line issues flagged by `flake8` (`E302`, `E303`)
- Split multi-import lines for clarity and `E401` compliance
- Resolved `F811` redefinition warning in `streamlit_app.py`

### Configuration
- Added `.flake8` config file with project-wide linting rules:
  - `max-line-length = 100`
  - `ignore = E203, W503` for compatibility with `black`
  - Excluded `.venv`, `__pycache__`, and build directories

### Notes
- LLM fuzzy TOC logic is complete and test-covered, but not yet surfaced in the UI
- Codebase now passes both `flake8` and `black`
- CI and local lint behavior are now consistent and enforceable

## [v0.10.0] ‚Äì LLM Fuzzy TOC Comparison (UI Integration)

### Added
- Streamlit sidebar checkbox to enable **LLM fuzzy TOC comparison**
- `use_llm` toggle passed from UI ‚Üí `structure_check.py` ‚Üí `compare_toc()`
- Support for optional fuzzy match results from GPT-4 alongside strict structure check
- New expandable section in UI: **"üß† LLM Fuzzy Match Results"**, rendered using Markdown
- Dynamic fallback handling: strict vs. fuzzy results display correctly based on toggle

### Fixed
- `display_structure_check_results()` updated to support both old and new result formats (with or without `strict_comparison`)
- Eliminated crash when LLM output structure differed from default TOC comparison return

### Notes
- This completes full UI surfacing of the LLM fuzzy comparison logic implemented in `v0.9.1`
- First version where users can visibly benefit from AI-enhanced structural analysis

## [v0.11.0] ‚Äì Traceability Export & Inline Requirement ID Detection

### Added
- Implemented inline requirement ID detection for sections.
- Added traceability export functionality (JSON/CSV) based on parsed SRS sections.
- Integrated a "Generate Traceability Export" button to Streamlit UI, enabling traceability downloads.
- Session state used to preserve parsed sections and analysis results across reruns.
- Tests for `build_traceability_index()`, `export_traceability_as_json()`, and `export_traceability_as_csv()` added and verified.

### Notes
- The summary section for cross-section analysis remains a future task.

## [v0.12.0] - Requirements Grouping, Gap Detection, and Summary View

### Added
- `group_requirements()` in `requirement_grouper.py` to perform keyword-based categorization of REQ lines using themes such as Authentication, Error Handling, Security, and Data Handling.
- `detect_gaps()` in `requirement_grouper.py` to identify missing or empty requirement categories.
- `extract_requirement_lines()` in `export.py` to isolate REQ-xxx lines from section bodies for grouping logic.
- `generate_requirement_summary()` in `export.py` to format grouped counts and gap detection results as a clean Markdown summary.
- `generate_requirement_summary_from_sections()` in `export.py` to support UI-friendly input from parsed sections.
- Summary section added to Streamlit UI under ‚Äúüìä Requirements Overview‚Äù, triggered after parsing and analysis.
- Full test coverage added for:
  - `group_requirements()` and `detect_gaps()` in `test_requirement_grouper.py`
  - `extract_requirement_lines()` and both summary functions in `test_export.py`

### Changed
- `detect_gaps()` now flags categories with empty requirement lists as missing (not just absent keys).
- Updated all relevant tests to reflect the corrected gap detection logic.

### Notes
- This version finalizes all non-LLM grouping and summary logic in preparation for semantic LLM enhancements.
- Architecture remains LLM-ready: grouping logic is modular, and summary generation can be replaced with synthesis logic in later version

## [v0.13.0] - LLM Summary Synthesis
### Added
- `summarize_analysis()` in `llm.py` to synthesize section-level analyses into a high-level overview
- Streamlit UI block displaying GPT-4 generated summary using Markdown

## [v1.1.0] ‚Äì Flask Interface Bootstrap

### Added
- New `flask_app/` module scaffolding Flask-based frontend for future migration
- `run.py` entry point with app factory pattern in `app/__init__.py`
- `routes.py` with basic `Blueprint` and root (`/`) route
- `templates/index.html` placeholder page
- Verified functional Flask dev server on `http://localhost:5000`

### Notes
- This begins the transition from Streamlit to Flask (Day 1 of Flask migration plan)
- Streamlit UI remains frozen under `ui/` for reference only

## [v1.2.0] ‚Äì Flask File Upload + Parser Integration

### Added
- File upload route `/upload` connected to `read_uploaded_file()` and `parse_sections_with_bodies()`
- `parsed.html` template to display parsed SRS sections and extracted REQ IDs
- Compatibility fallback in `read_uploaded_file()` for both Flask (`.filename`) and Streamlit (`.name`)

### Fixed
- Eliminated `NoneType` errors from empty reads or incorrect file extension checks
- Ensured `.txt` and `.docx` files decode correctly and trigger parsing flow

### Notes
- Parser remains centralized under `app/parser.py`
- Test compatibility preserved by supporting both `.name` and `.filename` paths
- This completes file ingestion and output rendering in Flask (Day 2 of Flask migration plan)

## [v1.3.0] ‚Äì LLM Requirement Analysis Integration

### Added
- Integrated `analyze_requirement()` from `llm.py` into the `/upload` route
- Each parsed section now includes LLM-generated analysis of clarity, ambiguity, vagueness, and testability
- `parsed.html` updated to display `analysis` output using `|safe` rendering for Markdown-style results

### Fixed
- Resolved `TemplateNotFound` errors in route tests by explicitly setting `template_folder` in Flask app
- Corrected test patching scope by targeting `flask_app.web.routes.analyze_requirement` directly

### Tested
- Added `tests/test_routes.py` with full upload/parse/analyze round-trip test
- LLM API calls mocked with `unittest.mock.patch` to avoid real API usage
- Confirmed clean test suite with `pytest`, `black`, `flake8`, and `mypy`

### Notes
- Output format preserves original parsing structure while appending LLM insights
- Analysis logic is optional and modular for future toggles or feature isolation
- This completes Day 3 of the Flask migration plan

## [v1.4.0] ‚Äì LLM Test Suggestion Integration

### Added
- Integrated `suggest_tests()` from `llm.py` into the `/upload` route
- Displayed bullet-style test suggestions for each section in `parsed.html`

### Fixed
- Extended test in `test_routes.py` to mock `suggest_tests()` output alongside `analyze_requirement()`
- Ensured test suggestion rendering is skipped for short inputs by leveraging built-in length guard

### Notes
- Test suggestions are Markdown-formatted and safely rendered
- All LLM calls remain fully mocked in test environment
- This completes Day 4 of the Flask migration sprint

## [v1.5.0] ‚Äì Traceability Markdown Export

### Added
- **/traceability** route in `flask_app/web/routes.py`  
  - Accepts either a freshly-uploaded file **or** the raw SRS text returned via a hidden form field.
- **format_traceability_as_markdown()** in `app/export.py`  
  - Builds a Markdown table of `Requirement ID ‚Üí Section` using existing `build_traceability_index()`.
- **Download Traceability Markdown** button in `parsed.html`  
  - Posts the raw document back via a hidden `<textarea>`‚Äîno extra file browse required.

### Tested
- Extended `tests/test_routes.py`  
  - Upload test still mocks LLMs.  
  - New `test_traceability_download_via_text` posts `srs_text` and asserts Markdown output.
- Updated `test_export.py` sample data to include `id` key, matching real parser output.

### Fixed
- Removed duplicate code block in `/traceability` route; file and raw-text handling share a single logic path.

### Notes
- No real OpenAI calls in any tests (all relevant functions patched).  
- Table downloads as `traceability.md` and renders correctly for SRS files containing `REQ-` IDs.
